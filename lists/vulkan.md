### Techniques





### Tutorials
- #### [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) [Beginner - Intermediate]
	- Vulkan (C++) tutorials. This tutorial is a little bit outdated, and not really convincing.
  
- #### [Vulkan API tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUXvZMiAqNbK8jd7s52BIDtCbZnKNGp0P) [Intermediate - Advanced]
	- Vulkan (C++) tutorials. These tutorials are more comprehensive, but not thorough enough for a beginner. 
  Therefore, I advise to follow these tutorials only if you are already comfortable with OpenGL 3.3, and of course, C++14.
 
- #### [Vulkan API official tutorial](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/1.0.61.1/windows/tutorial/html/index.html) [Beginner - Advanced]
	- Vulkan (C++) tutorials. This tutorial is clearly the best on the net. You'll see all the steps, and learn how to use Vulkan and its tools really quickly. I highly recommend it.

### Examples

- #### [Sascha Willems Vulkan Examples](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan) [Begginner - Advanced]
	- Vulkan (C++) examples. This project is really cool to see how to use Vulkan as a whole. But the code is pretty outdated (no smart pointers for example), not correctly classified, and fullscreen has bugs.
